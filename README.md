## Project Title ##
timetable



### Introduction ###
timetable will be a flexible timetable to make life easier and more organised.


###Project Description ###
timetable will eventually be an application that is easily managed and
organised: by spending a few minutes inputting a few details; you can be organised
for weeks on end. With term dates and exam dates the application will automatically
switch between a weekly timetable and a clear schedule with only exams booked.

The aim is for the application to be intelligent and to do more of the scheduling work
than you; giving you more time to do what you need to do.

The application will of course make room for other events; with the ability to clear
the schedule for the next two weeks etc.
